# 🇮🇳 RISC-V SoC Lab — C2S Program (Chip to Startup)

Welcome to the RISC-V SoC Lab repository, developed as part of the Chip to Startup (C2S) initiative by the Government of India. This national program empowers institutions to explore and design silicon chips using the open-source RISC-V architecture.

## 📘 What This Is

This repository is maintained by participants selected from C2S-affiliated institutes that have access to Synopsys EDA tools and the SCL180 PDK. It serves as a collaborative environment for learning and developing complete RISC-V based SoC designs—from RTL to GDSII.

## 🚀 Current Stage — Phase 1

- 🔧 Toolchain and environment setup  
- 🗂️ Repository structure and Git versioning  
- ✅ Functional testing using basic RISC-V programs (e.g., Hello World)  
- 🧪 Preliminary simulation and synthesis verification

## 🛠 Tools in Use

- Synopsys EDA Suite (VCS, Design Compiler, IC Compiler)  
- RISC-V GCC Toolchain  
- SCL 180nm PDK  
- Optional: ModelSim, GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis

## 🌱 Our Goal

To contribute meaningfully to India’s semiconductor design ecosystem by building open-source, RISC-V-based hardware with academic rigor and practical workflows.

Let’s build the next generation of Indian silicon innovation 🇮🇳
